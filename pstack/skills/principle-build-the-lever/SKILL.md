## Droid harness contract

This is the Factory Droid port. Read `${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT}/DROID-ADAPTER.md` before executing this workflow. This contract replaces only harness-specific mechanics below; retain every workflow gate, exception, role, rubric, evidence requirement, and supporting file. Source autonomy language never expands the actual user's authorization.

- Load skills with Droid `Skill` and full payloads with `Read`. `${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT}` expands in SKILL.md; substitute its resolved value in supporting files and worker briefs. Keep adjacent original relative paths intact.
- Use `Execute`, `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Create`, `Edit`/`ApplyPatch`, `TodoWrite`, `AskUser`, `WebSearch`, and `FetchUrl`, according to the actual session schemas. Cursor `AskQuestion` means Droid `AskUser`; `Shell`/`Bash` means `Execute`.
- Task has no `model`, `readonly`, or `environment` fields. Select an installed custom droid with model and tool policy instead; read `DROID-ADAPTER.md` for role mapping. Every subagent is noninteractive and cannot spawn Task. The parent owns all fan-out and collection, including fan-out requested by delegated workflow prompts.
- Prefer native `droid-control` for browser/terminal/desktop evidence and `skill-creation` for authoring. `deslop` is bundled. `control-cli`/`control-ui` below refer to the native routing wrappers in this plugin, not Cursor team-kit installation.
- Cursor rule, transcript, cloud VM, Project-store and event APIs are not available just because their instructions are preserved. Follow the exact adapter route or report the missing capability. Never pass Cursor model slugs or invent equivalent APIs.

# Build the Lever

When the work isn't trivial, build the tool that does it instead of doing it by hand.

A codemod, generator, or script does the work the same way every time and reruns for free. The tool is one artifact a reviewer can read and rerun to check the work. Hand-done changes can only be re-verified by redoing them. A deterministic script turns "trust me" into "run this".

Default to building the lever. Skip it only when the task is trivial, a couple of obvious edits you can see at a glance.

- Do the first unit by hand to learn the recipe, then build the tool. Prove it by rerunning it on that unit and diffing against your hand-done version. Make the lever safe to rerun.
- Codemod or script for edits, generator for repetitive files, a dump-to-sqlite query for analysis, a rerunnable check for verification.
- A deterministic lever beats fan-out. If the tool can process every unit in one pass, run it yourself. Don't fan out delegates to hand-apply what a script can do.
- When you fan work out to subagents, write the lever as a skill they all read: the recipe, the verification contract, and the do-not-touch fences in one artifact. Keep it outside the delegates' write scope so they can't quietly edit the contract.
- Applying this principle produces a file. If you cited it and there is no codemod, script, generator, or delegate skill in the diff, you didn't apply it.
- Commit the lever when the work outlives the session.

The bar is triviality, not repetition. A one-off still earns a lever when the lever is what makes the work checkable. Per the [Laziness Protocol](../principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md), build the smallest script that does or proves the job, never a framework.

Distinct from [Encode Lessons in Structure](../principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md), which makes a recurring instruction a durable guardrail. This is throughput and reviewability on the work in front of you. For scripting the verification itself, see [Prove It Works](../principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md).
