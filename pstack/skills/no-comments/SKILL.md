## Droid harness contract

This is the Factory Droid port. Read `${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT}/DROID-ADAPTER.md` before executing this workflow. This contract replaces only harness-specific mechanics below; retain every workflow gate, exception, role, rubric, evidence requirement, and supporting file. Source autonomy language never expands the actual user's authorization.

- Load skills with Droid `Skill` and full payloads with `Read`. `${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT}` expands in SKILL.md; substitute its resolved value in supporting files and worker briefs. Keep adjacent original relative paths intact.
- Use `Execute`, `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Create`, `Edit`/`ApplyPatch`, `TodoWrite`, `AskUser`, `WebSearch`, and `FetchUrl`, according to the actual session schemas. Cursor `AskQuestion` means Droid `AskUser`; `Shell`/`Bash` means `Execute`.
- Task has no `model`, `readonly`, or `environment` fields. Select an installed custom droid with model and tool policy instead; read `DROID-ADAPTER.md` for role mapping. Every subagent is noninteractive and cannot spawn Task. The parent owns all fan-out and collection, including fan-out requested by delegated workflow prompts.
- Prefer native `droid-control` for browser/terminal/desktop evidence and `skill-creation` for authoring. `deslop` is bundled. `control-cli`/`control-ui` below refer to the native routing wrappers in this plugin, not Cursor team-kit installation.
- Cursor rule, transcript, cloud VM, Project-store and event APIs are not available just because their instructions are preserved. Follow the exact adapter route or report the missing capability. Never pass Cursor model slugs or invent equivalent APIs.

# No comments

Spawn Comment Sicko. Act on accepted findings.

Defer to Comment Sicko's fresh perspective.

## Scope

Use the caller's files or diff. Otherwise use the current diff against the base branch, default `main`, including the working tree.

## Steps

1. Spawn `Task` with `subagent_type: "comment-sicko"`. Pass the scope. If the reviewer requires `how` or `why`, it returns the exact questions to the parent. The parent runs those full sibling subgraphs, collects evidence, and starts a fresh reviewer with the original scope plus findings. The reviewer never launches nested Task. The parent applies approved comment deletions; a report-only droid does not acquire edit permission. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill. Do not restate its rules.
2. Inspect its report and diff. Reject application-code edits, scope escapes, exception-protected deletions, misstated `MUST KILL` reasons, and flags that treat kept intentional code as guilty. Reshape flags on our-code surprises stay actionable. Do not restore those comments. A keep survives only with proof it is about something we cannot change. Audit missed scoped lint and TypeScript suppressions. Correctness or safety suppressions stay actionable `MUST KILL`s. Restore deletions only with exact exceptions and scoped proof. Before accepting thin `IMPORTANT` or `do not remove` kills or keeps, run `/how` or `/why` on their symbol. If a kill is ambiguous, do not restore. If a keep is refuted or still ambiguous, delete it. Revert and rerun one rejected report with the failure named. Reject a second, report it open, and fail `/no-comments`.
3. Fix trivial accepted flags directly by deleting a dead path, dropping a parameter, or using the real API. If any fix needs a shape, run `/architect` once for the accepted set and surrounding code. Stop at the sketch. Architect shapes. Step 4 implements.
4. Implement the smallest root-cause fix in scope. Remove every named workaround. If the root cause is out of scope, land the smallest in-scope fix and report the rest open. The **principle-fix-root-causes** and **principle-redesign-from-first-principles** skills guide intent only. Neither authorizes widening the fence nor fixing instances outside it. Never bolt on symptom guards.
5. Constraint comments say `do not remove`, `do not change wording`, or `talk to X before changing`. Leave keeps about things we cannot change. Offer the cheapest in-scope type, runtime, test, or CI lint. Wait for interactive approval. Unattended and eval require caller pre-approval. If approved, encode then delete. Otherwise delete, report the constraint open, and sketch out-of-scope work.
6. Report the deletion count, restored comments, reruns, architect sketch, fixes, encoding offers, encodings, unenforced constraints, and other open work.
